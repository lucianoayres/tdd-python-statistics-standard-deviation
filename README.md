# tdd-python-statistics-standard-deviation
This repository contains Python code for calculating the standard deviation of a dataset. The standard deviation is a statistical measure that indicates how much the values in a dataset are spread out around the mean.

### Features:
- Calculation of the mean of a list of numbers
- Subtraction of a number from each element in a list
- Squaring each element in a list
- Calculation of the standard deviation using the provided functions

### Test-Driven Development (TDD):
Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology has been used in the development of this code. Unit tests are included to ensure the correctness of the implemented functions.
